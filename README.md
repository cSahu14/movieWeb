### Project Overview -

A basic movie app using React JS, Redux Toolkit, and Saga would allow users to browse and search for movies, view movie details.

Here is an overview of how the app might work:
 1. The user arrives at the app's homepage, where they can see a list of popular movies.
 2. The user can then click on a movie to view more details about it, including its overview, release date, and rating.
 3. The user can also search for movies using a search bar. The search suggestion results will be appearing below the search bar and user can select the movie and redirect directly to that movie page.
 4. After submit the input field by search button or enter keyboard button, then the search results will be display on the main page.


To build this app, we could use React JS as our frontend library, Redux Toolkit as our state management tool, and Redux Saga as our middleware for handling asynchronous actions.
